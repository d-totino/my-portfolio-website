        <h3>Getting Started with Web Development</h3>
        <p><em>June 2025</em></p>
        <p>In ITEC 3020, I've been learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. It has been really interesting to learn how to actually create my own website while doing this assignment and I've come to realize it is one of my favourite things to do when it comes to coding!</p>

        <h3>How I Built This Site</h3>
        <p><em>June 2025</em></p>
        <p>This portfolio was built using HTML and CSS. I have been using techniques taught during lectures and found in our course slides. If I found something I wanted to add and was unsure how I also used resources found online to guide me through the process!</p>
